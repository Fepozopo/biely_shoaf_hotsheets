# Biely Shoaf Hotsheets

## Project Overview
The **Biely Shoaf Hotsheets** project was made to take the data from reports in Sage 100 and put that data into what my boss calls “hotsheets”. He used to spend hours manually entering this data himself and I made this to save him from that headache.
This project provides tools for managing sales, inventory, and generating reports. It includes Python scripts that help automate these processes.

## Features
- **Sales Management**: Automated processing of sales data.
- **Stock Tracking**: Easily monitor and update inventory levels.
- **Reports**: Generate hotsheets to track performance and trends.
